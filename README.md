1. How it works?
- This script uses to add trusted sites to outlook by editing regedit in mutiple windows 10 in the domain controller environment.

2. Requires:
- Windows 10 pro (version 1803 or higher)
- Domain controller environment
- WinRM enables already.
- User domain admin with full administrator right in the client computer.
- File excel contains all computer names in the same column. (csv extension)

4. How to use it?
- First one, you have to create the excel file with the same "C:\computerList.csv" or you can create another one but have to change it in script.
- Change your domain admin user from truong_tranduy to your own.
- All above things, I have noted in the script. Please read and take it carefully.
- Run it with administrator right if something went wrong.
